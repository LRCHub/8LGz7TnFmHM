[00:00.69] Stop, drop
[00:03.49] Shut 'em down, open up shop singing
[00:06.06] Oh, no
[00:08.86] That's how Ruff Ryders roll
[00:22.36] 
[00:10.83] I'm going down, down baby
[00:12.24] Yo' street in a Range Rover
[00:13.74] Street sweeper baby
[00:15.02] Cocked ready to let it go
[00:16.38] Shimmy, shimmy cocoa, what?
[00:17.99] Listen to it pound
[00:19.10] Light it up and take a puff
[00:20.74] Pass it to me now
[00:29.24] 
[00:21.50] I got that wood grain with the leather seats
[00:24.27] I got the windows so dark you need a flashlight to see me
[00:27.86] Smoking on that doja
[00:29.67] Four of my buddies in the back screamin', "No limit soldiers"
[01:00.17] 
[00:32.78] One, two, three and to the four
[00:35.53] Snoop Doggy Doggy and Dr. Dre is at the door
[00:38.30] Ready to make an entrance so back on up
[00:40.44] 'Cause you know we're about to rip stuff up
[00:42.60] Give me the microphone first so I can bust it like a bubble
[00:45.72] L.A. and Nashville together, man, you know you in trouble
[00:48.83] Ain't nothing but a G thang, baby
[00:51.44] Y'all locked out people, so we're crazy
[01:10.94] 
[00:54.14] Remember walking you from school and homies hate me
[00:56.91] But I ain't tripping, 'cause I knew one day, girl you'll be my lady
[01:00.06] You'll probably have my babies, I know it sounds crazy
[01:02.68] But thugs need love and if you real girl save me
[01:26.68] 
[01:05.86] Wake up, wake up, wake up it's the first of the month
[01:08.79] Get up, get up, get up cash your checks and get up
[01:11.37] Wake up, wake up, wake up it's the first of the month
[01:13.95] Get up, get up, get up everybody singing
[01:33.95] 
[01:16.58] Give me two pairs
[01:18.95] 'Cause I need two pairs
[01:21.72] So, I can get to stomping in my Air Force Ones
[01:24.82] Get to stomping in my Air Force Ones
[01:42.82] 
[01:27.08] Saying colt 45 and two zigzags
[01:29.87] Baby, that's all we need
[01:32.34] And we can go to the park after dark
[01:35.36] We can smoke that tumbleweed
[01:37.95] As the marijuana burn, we can take our turn
[01:40.84] Singing them dirty rap songs
[01:43.50] So stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong
[01:46.06] Selling tapes from here to Hong Kong
[02:04.06] 
[01:48.71] So roll, roll, roll my joint
[01:52.07] Pick out the seeds and stems
[01:54.13] Feeling high as hell, flying through Palmdale
[01:57.08] Skating on Dayton rims
[02:08.08] 
[01:59.71] So roll, roll, the '83
[02:02.54] Cadillac Coupé De Ville
[02:05.12] If my tapes and my CDs just don't sell
[02:08.01] I bet my Caddy will
[02:17.51] 
[02:10.16] I wanna be a baller, shot caller
[02:13.76] 20 inch blades on my Impala
[02:16.85] Caller getting paid tonight
[02:19.01] Swisher rolled tight, gotta sprayed by Ike
[02:21.67] I hit the highway
[02:23.72] Making money the flyaway
[02:26.59] But there's got to be a better way
[02:29.43] A better way, better way, yeah
[02:44.43] 
[02:32.92] Boys and girls, wanna hear a true story?
[02:35.57] Saturday night I was at this real wild party
[02:38.69] They had the liquor overflowing the cup
[02:40.50] About five or six strippers trying to work for a buck
[02:43.41] And I took one girl outside with me
[02:45.92] Her name was Maria, she went to junior high with me
[02:48.82] I said, "Why you up in there dancing for cash?
[02:51.40] I guess a whole a lot's changed since I seen you last."
[02:54.19] She said
[02:58.19] 
[02:54.96] "What would you do if your son was at home
[02:57.56] Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
[02:59.84] And he's hungry
[03:01.31] And the only way to feed him is to
[03:02.87] Sleep with a man for a little bit of money
[03:23.87] 
[03:05.21] And his daddy's gone
[03:06.82] Somewhere smoking rock now, in and out of lockdown
[03:09.44] I ain't got a job now
[03:11.44] So for you this is just a good time
[03:13.91] But for me this is what I call life"
[03:18.95] Yeah
